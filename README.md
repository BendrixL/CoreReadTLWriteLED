# CoreReadTLWriteLED
Core firmware to read photresistor and temp sensor and toggle LED

This code is for compilation in Particle Dev  www.particle.io
It reads two analog values and has a function that will toggle a digital out.
The anlog values on my hardware are a thermistor and a phtoresistor.
This program is designed to work in concert with SparkSDK_Try Mobile SDK IOS app
Sorry, can't provide doc for assemblying the hardware, but might add later.  Not difficult to figure out.
